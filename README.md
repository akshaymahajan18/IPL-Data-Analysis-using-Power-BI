# IPL Data Analysis using Power BI


# Objectives - 

(1) Perform a detailed analysis of IPL matches across all seasons (2008 to 2024) to uncover key trends and patterns.                                                                                              

(2) Identify top-performing batsmen and bowlers using metrics like runs, strike rate, wickets, and economy rate.

(3) Determine the impact of toss decisions on match outcomes.

(4) Analyze win/loss ratios for teams at different stadiums.

(5) Analyze match results to see which strategy (batting first or chasing) has a higher success rate.

(6) Design an interactive Power BI dashboard to present key insights with charts, graphs, and filters for user interaction.
